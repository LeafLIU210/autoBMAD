# Story 1.3: Comprehensive Testing Suite

**Status:** Ready for Development

---

## Story Details

**As a developer,**
I want thorough unit tests for the bubble sort implementation,
so that I can be confident the algorithm works correctly for all edge cases.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Test empty list, single element, and multiple element scenarios
2. Test already sorted, reverse sorted, and random order inputs
3. Test with negative numbers, floats, and mixed numeric types
4. Test error handling for None, non-iterable, and non-comparable inputs
5. Test that original input list is not modified (pure function behavior)
6. Achieve >95% code coverage for the bubble sort implementation
7. Include parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios

## Story Information
