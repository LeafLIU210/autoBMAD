# Story 1.2: Basic Bubble Sort Implementation

**Status:** Ready for Development

---

## Story Details

**As a user,**
I want a working bubble sort algorithm that can sort lists of numbers,
so that I can understand and use the fundamental sorting algorithm.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Implement bubble_sort() function that accepts a list and returns a sorted copy
2. Function handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly
3. Raises appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs (None, non-iterable)
4. Includes comprehensive docstring with algorithm explanation and complexity analysis
5. Implementation follows the standard bubble sort algorithm with nested loops
6. Type hints for all function parameters and return values

## Story Information

**Estimated Effort:** 3 days
**Dependencies:** Story 1.1
**Priority:** High
**Story ID:** 1.2
**Epic:** Core Algorithm Foundation

## Notes

- Focus on simplicity and clarity over optimization
- Ensure code is educational and well-commented
- Prioritize testability and maintainability
