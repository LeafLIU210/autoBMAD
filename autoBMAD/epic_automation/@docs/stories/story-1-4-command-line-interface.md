# Story 1.4: Command-Line Interface

**Status:** Ready for Development

---

## Story Details

**As a user,**
I want a command-line interface to test the bubble sort algorithm,
so that I can easily demonstrate and experiment with the implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create CLI entry point that accepts arrays as command-line arguments
2. Support reading arrays from files or standard input
3. Provide options for different output formats (sorted array, detailed process)
4. Include help documentation and usage examples
5. Handle command-line errors gracefully with helpful error messages
6. Support both interactive and batch modes of operation

## Story Information

**Estimated Effort:** 2 days
**Dependencies:** Story 1.2
**Priority:** Medium
**Story ID:** 1.4
**Epic:** Core Algorithm Foundation

## Notes

- Focus on simplicity and clarity over optimization
- Ensure code is educational and well-commented
- Prioritize testability and maintainability
