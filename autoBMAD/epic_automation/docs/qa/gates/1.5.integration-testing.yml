summary: |
  CRITICAL REGRESSION: Story 1.5 has completely regressed since the previous review.
  The spec_automation module that was previously implemented (131/142 tests passing) 
  no longer exists. This represents a total loss of all progress. The story cannot 
  pass and requires complete re-implementation from scratch.
  
  The story has devolved from "major implementation exists" to "nothing exists".
  This is a critical blocker that requires immediate attention before any further 
  development can proceed.

key_findings:
  critical_regression:
    - "spec_automation module: COMPLETELY MISSING (was: 131/142 tests passing)"
    - "All Python implementation files: REMOVED (was: 10+ files)"
    - "Test suite: ELIMINATED (was: 142 tests collected)"
    - "Example documents: MISSING (was: 2/3 created)"
    - "Integration tests: NEVER EXISTED (was: Multiple test files created)"
    - "Documentation: NO README (was: Missing but structure existed)"
    
  verification:
    - "autoBMAD/spec_automation/: Does not exist ✗"
    - "README.md: Does not exist ✗"
    - "Test directory: Does not exist ✗"
    - "Python files: None found ✗"
    - "Example docs: None found ✗"

  concerns:
    - "COMPLETE LOSS OF PROGRESS: All previous implementation has been removed"
    - "No baseline exists to build upon - must start from zero"
    - "Quality gates cannot be assessed due to no code existence"
    - "Acceptance criteria impossible to verify"
    - "Team should investigate what happened to the previous implementation"

recommendations:
  critical:
    - "INVESTIGATE: Determine what happened to the previously implemented module"
    - "RESTORE: Recover previous implementation if possible from version control"
    - "REBUILD: If unrecoverable, rebuild spec_automation module from scratch"
    - "VALIDATE: Verify all dependencies (Stories 1.1-1.4) are still intact"
    
  important:
    - "Implement all 8 acceptance criteria in correct order"
    - "Create comprehensive test suite with >80% coverage"
    - "Generate all required documentation (README.md, API docs)"
    - "Create all 3 example documents (Sprint Proposal, Functional Spec, Technical Plan)"
    - "Ensure all quality gates pass (Ruff, BasedPyright, Pytest)"

pass_criteria_met:
  document_completeness: false
  no_critical_failures: false
  tool_validation_acceptable: false

next_steps:
  - "Investigate regression and restore previous implementation"
  - "If unrecoverable, restart story from Story 1.1 prerequisites"
  - "Rebuild spec_automation module completely"
  - "Re-run quality gates only after full implementation exists"
  - "Schedule emergency retro to understand what caused complete loss of progress"
