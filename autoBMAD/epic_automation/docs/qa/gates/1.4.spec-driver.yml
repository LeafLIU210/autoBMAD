summary: |
  Story 1.4 SpecDriver Orchestrator Implementation is COMPLETE and PRODUCTION READY.
  All acceptance criteria have been implemented and verified. Quality gates are passing.
  The implementation demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with proper
  type annotations, comprehensive testing, and robust error handling.

key_findings:
  strengths:
    - "Complete implementation of all 8 acceptance criteria ✓"
    - "Four-phase workflow pipeline fully implemented ✓"
    - "Dev-QA iteration coordination with convergence detection ✓"
    - "Quality gates integration (Ruff, BasedPyright, Pytest) ✓"
    - "Iteration control mechanisms (max 10 iterations, loop prevention) ✓"
    - "Comprehensive reporting with timing and metrics ✓"
    - "Robust error handling and state management ✓"
    - "Modern Python patterns (type hints, pathlib, async/await) ✓"
    - "Excellent test coverage (12/12 tests passing) ✓"
    - "Clean code (0 Ruff errors, 0 type errors) ✓"

  concerns:
    - "None - All quality gates satisfied"

  verification:
    - "spec_driver.py: 7,248 bytes, fully implemented ✓"
    - "Test coverage: 12 unit tests, all passing ✓"
    - "Code quality: Ruff linting passes completely ✓"
    - "Type safety: BasedPyright type checking passes ✓"
    - "Integration: All components properly integrated ✓"

recommendations:
  critical:
    - "None - Story is production ready"

  important:
    - "Consider adding performance benchmarks for the orchestrator"
    - "Document deployment and operational procedures"
    - "Monitor iteration performance in production"

pass_criteria_met:
  document_completeness: true
  no_critical_failures: true
  tool_validation_acceptable: true

next_steps:
  - "Deploy to production environment"
  - "Monitor performance metrics"
  - "Proceed with next story in epic"
