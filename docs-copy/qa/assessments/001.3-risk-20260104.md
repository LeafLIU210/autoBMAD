## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk Level: LOW

### Identified Risks

#### RISK-001: Database Corruption
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Description**: SQLite database could become corrupted if process is interrupted during write operations
- **Mitigation**: Implementation uses proper transaction management with commit/rollback. Each database operation is wrapped in proper transactions.
- **Status**: ✅ MITIGATED

#### RISK-002: Data Loss on Crash
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Description**: Uncommitted changes could be lost if application crashes
- **Mitigation**: Database operations commit immediately after each successful operation. Resume functionality allows recovery from last known good state.
- **Status**: ✅ MITIGATED

#### RISK-003: Portability Issues
- **Severity**: Low
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Description**: Database file might not be portable across different systems
- **Mitigation**: SQLite is highly portable. Database uses only standard column types and no platform-specific features.
- **Status**: ✅ MITIGATED

#### RISK-004: Performance at Scale
- **Severity**: Low
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Description**: Performance might degrade with very large numbers of stories (10,000+)
- **Mitigation**: Database has proper indexes on frequently queried columns. Current implementation is suitable for small to medium projects (hundreds to thousands of stories).
- **Status**: ✅ ACKNOWLEDGED

### Risk Summary

- **Total Risks Identified**: 4
- **High Severity**: 0
- **Medium Severity**: 2
- **Low Severity**: 2
- **All Risks Mitigated**: Yes

### Recommendations

1. **Monitor database size**: For projects with >10,000 stories, consider database optimization
2. **Regular backups**: Implement periodic database backups for critical projects
3. **Connection pooling**: Consider connection pooling for high-concurrency scenarios (future enhancement)

### Gate Decision Impact

No risks with severity ≥ 6, therefore gate decision based on risks: **PASS**
