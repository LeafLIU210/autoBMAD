  ❌ **STORY FAILS QUALITY GATE**

  The story document is severely incomplete and cannot be implemented or tested in its current state.
  Previous gate assessment of PASS was incorrect and has been corrected.

  **Immediate Actions Required:**
  1. Complete story document with all required sections
  2. Define clear, testable acceptance criteria
  3. Create actionable task breakdown
  4. Establish testing approach
  5. Review gate assessment process to prevent inaccurate evaluations

  Priority: CRITICAL - Must complete before any development work

next_steps:
  - [ ] Story author to complete document sections
  - [ ] Product owner to review story narrative
  - [ ] QA to re-review after corrections
  - [ ] Team to align on story writing standards
