nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Subprocess execution validated (basedpyright, ruff only). API key validation for Claude SDK. File path validation for source directory checks. Proper error handling prevents information leakage.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Async subprocess execution for basedpyright and ruff. Proper timeout controls on quality gate operations. Efficient JSON parsing for error collection. State manager integration with proper indexing.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout all methods. Graceful handling of missing dependencies and API keys. Retry logic with max 3 iterations. State persistence via state manager. Backward compatibility via --skip-quality flag.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive type annotations (Dict, Any, List, Optional). Google-style docstrings on all public methods. Clean, readable code following DRY/KISS principles. 7/7 integration tests passing. Configuration in basedpyright-workflow/pyproject.toml.'
