# Story 1.2: Basic Bubble Sort Implementation

## Status
**Approved**

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a working bubble sort algorithm that can sort lists of numbers,
**so that** I can understand and use the fundamental sorting algorithm.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement bubble_sort() function that accepts a list and returns a sorted copy
2. Function handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly
3. Raises appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs (None, non-iterable)
4. Includes comprehensive docstring with algorithm explanation and complexity analysis
5. Implementation follows the standard bubble sort algorithm with nested loops
6. Type hints for all function parameters and return values

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement core bubble_sort() function (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Create function with proper signature
  - [ ] Implement nested loop logic for bubble sort
  - [ ] Ensure function returns a sorted copy (non-destructive)
- [ ] Handle edge cases (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Test with empty list
  - [ ] Test with single element
  - [ ] Verify correct behavior for already sorted lists
- [ ] Add input validation (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Check for None input
  - [ ] Check for non-iterable inputs
  - [ ] Raise appropriate exceptions with clear messages
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Write detailed docstring
  - [ ] Include algorithm explanation
  - [ ] Document time and space complexity
  - [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] Add type hints (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add type hints for all parameters
  - [ ] Add return type annotation
  - [ ] Use appropriate typing modules if needed

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- Source code location: `src/` directory (from Story 1.1)
- Implementation file: `src/` (main bubble sort module)
- Test location: `tests/` directory (to be created in Story 1.3)

### Algorithm Requirements
- Standard bubble sort implementation using nested loops
- Algorithm should repeatedly step through the list, compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order
- The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted
- Should be educational and easy to understand

### Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n²) in worst and average case, O(n) in best case (already sorted)
- Space Complexity: O(1) - sorting is done in-place on a copy

### Type Hints Requirements
- Use `List[int]` or `List[float]` for input type
- Use `List[int]` or `List[float]` for return type
- Import from `typing` module if needed

### Exception Handling
- Raise `TypeError` for None or non-iterable inputs
- Ensure error messages are clear and helpful
- Consider raising `ValueError` for non-comparable types

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `tests/test_bubble_sort.py` (to be created in Story 1.3)
- Test standards: Use pytest framework with pytest-cov
- Coverage target: >95% (to be verified in Story 1.3)

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: Story 1.1 (Project Setup and Infrastructure) must be completed first
- This story depends on the project structure established in Story 1.1

### Notes
- Focus on clarity and educational value over optimization
- The function should NOT modify the input list (pure function behavior)
- Emphasize code readability and comprehensive comments
- Story 1.3 (Comprehensive Testing Suite) depends on this story being complete
- Story 1.4 (Command-Line Interface) depends on this story being complete
