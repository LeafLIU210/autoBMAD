# Story 1.3: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** thorough unit tests for the bubble sort implementation,
**so that** I can be confident the algorithm works correctly for all edge cases.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Test empty list, single element, and multiple element scenarios
2. Test already sorted, reverse sorted, and random order inputs
3. Test with negative numbers, floats, and mixed numeric types
4. Test error handling for None, non-iterable, and non-comparable inputs
5. Test that original input list is not modified (pure function behavior)
6. Achieve >95% code coverage for the bubble sort implementation
7. Include parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create tests/test_bubble_sort.py file (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Set up pytest configuration for coverage reporting
- [ ] Write tests for basic functionality (AC: #1)
  - [ ] Test empty list input
  - [ ] Test single element list
  - [ ] Test multiple element list (2-10 elements)
- [ ] Write tests for different input orders (AC: #2)
  - [ ] Test already sorted list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  - [ ] Test reverse sorted list [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
  - [ ] Test random order list
- [ ] Write tests for different numeric types (AC: #3)
  - [ ] Test with negative numbers
  - [ ] Test with floats
  - [ ] Test with mixed int and float
- [ ] Write tests for error handling (AC: #4)
  - [ ] Test with None input
  - [ ] Test with non-iterable input (e.g., integer)
  - [ ] Test with non-comparable types
- [ ] Test pure function behavior (AC: #5)
  - [ ] Verify original list is not modified
- [ ] Implement parameterized tests for efficiency (AC: #7)
- [ ] Run coverage analysis and achieve >95% (AC: #6)
- [ ] Fix any tests that fail

## Dev Notes
This story creates comprehensive unit tests to ensure the bubble sort implementation works correctly across all scenarios. The tests should be thorough and cover edge cases that might not be obvious.

Key testing considerations:
- Bubble sort should work with any comparable numeric types
- The function must not modify the original input list (pure function)
- Proper error handling for invalid inputs
- Test coverage must exceed 95%

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: tests/test_bubble_sort.py
- Use pytest with @pytest.mark.parametrize for parameterized tests
- Use pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- Follow naming convention: test_function_name_scenario
- Include assertions that verify both correctness and behavior

### Dependencies
- Depends on Story 1.2 (bubble sort implementation must exist first)
- Tests import from src.bubble_sort module
