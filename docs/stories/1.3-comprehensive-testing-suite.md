# Story 1.3: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** thorough unit tests for the bubble sort implementation,
**so that** I can be confident the algorithm works correctly for all edge cases.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Test empty list, single element, and multiple element scenarios
2. Test already sorted, reverse sorted, and random order inputs
3. Test with negative numbers, floats, and mixed numeric types
4. Test error handling for None, non-iterable, and non-comparable inputs
5. Test that original input list is not modified (pure function behavior)
6. Achieve >95% code coverage for the bubble sort implementation
7. Include parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create comprehensive test file (AC: #7)
  - [ ] Setup pytest configuration and fixtures
  - [ ] Import necessary testing utilities
  - [ ] Organize tests with clear test class/group structure
- [ ] Test basic functionality scenarios (AC: #1)
  - [ ] Test empty list input
  - [ ] Test single element list
  - [ ] Test multiple element list (2, 5, 10+ elements)
- [ ] Test various input orderings (AC: #2)
  - [ ] Test already sorted input
  - [ ] Test reverse sorted input
  - [ ] Test random order input
  - [ ] Test with duplicate elements
- [ ] Test different numeric types (AC: #3)
  - [ ] Test with negative numbers
  - [ ] Test with floats
  - [ ] Test with mixed int and float
  - [ ] Test with zero values
- [ ] Test error handling (AC: #4)
  - [ ] Test None input handling
  - [ ] Test non-iterable input handling
  - [ ] Test non-comparable elements (if applicable)
- [ ] Test pure function behavior (AC: #5)
  - [ ] Verify original list is not modified
  - [ ] Test with various list sizes
- [ ] Achieve target coverage (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Run coverage analysis
  - [ ] Identify uncovered code paths
  - [ ] Add tests for missing coverage
  - [ ] Verify >95% coverage threshold

## Dev Notes
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: tests/test_bubble_sort.py
- Test standards: pytest with pytest-cov for coverage
- Testing frameworks: pytest, pytest.mark.parametrize
- Code coverage: Must achieve >95% coverage
- Test organization: Group tests by functionality

### Relevant Information
- Dependencies: Story 1.2 (Basic Implementation)
- Focus: Exhaustive edge case coverage
- Test patterns: Use parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
- Coverage tool: Use pytest-cov or coverage.py
- Documentation: Document test cases and their purposes

### Source Tree Considerations
- Test file: tests/test_bubble_sort.py (parallel to bubblesort/bubble_sort.py)
- Conftest: tests/conftest.py for shared fixtures if needed
- Coverage report: Generate HTML and terminal coverage reports
- Test data: Consider fixtures for common test data

### Testing Strategy
- Use pytest.mark.parametrize for multiple test cases
- Test edge cases first (empty, single element)
- Test normal cases second (sorted, reverse, random)
- Test error cases third (invalid inputs)
- Test immutability separately to verify pure function behavior
- Run coverage on every test run

### Coverage Goals
- Statement coverage: >95%
- Branch coverage: Track and minimize uncovered branches
- Function coverage: 100%
- Critical path coverage: 100% (especially error handling)
