# Story 1.3: Comprehensive Testing Suite

**Status:** Ready for Development

---

## Story

**As a developer,**
I want thorough unit tests for the bubble sort implementation,
so that I can be confident the algorithm works correctly for all edge cases.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Test empty list, single element, and multiple element scenarios
2. Test already sorted, reverse sorted, and random order inputs
3. Test with negative numbers, floats, and mixed numeric types
4. Test error handling for None, non-iterable, and non-comparable inputs
5. Test that original input list is not modified (pure function behavior)
6. Achieve >95% code coverage for the bubble sort implementation
7. Include parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios

---

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Setup test framework and structure (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Configure pytest in the project
  - [ ] Create test file for bubble sort
  - [ ] Setup coverage reporting
- [ ] Task 2: Test basic functionality (AC: #1)
  - [ ] Test empty list returns empty list
  - [ ] Test single element list returns same element
  - [ ] Test multiple element list sorts correctly
- [ ] Task 3: Test various input orders (AC: #2)
  - [ ] Test already sorted list
  - [ ] Test reverse sorted list
  - [ ] Test random order list
  - [ ] Test list with duplicate values
- [ ] Task 4: Test different data types (AC: #3)
  - [ ] Test with negative numbers
  - [ ] Test with floats
  - [ ] Test with mixed integers and floats
- [ ] Task 5: Test error handling (AC: #4)
  - [ ] Test None input raises appropriate exception
  - [ ] Test non-iterable input raises exception
  - [ ] Test non-comparable types raise exception
- [ ] Task 6: Test pure function behavior (AC: #5)
  - [ ] Verify original list is never modified
  - [ ] Test with multiple references to same list
- [ ] Task 7: Implement parameterized tests (AC: #7)
  - [ ] Use pytest.mark.parametrize for test data
  - [ ] Create comprehensive test scenarios
  - [ ] Ensure >95% code coverage

## Dev Notes

This story creates comprehensive tests for the bubble sort implementation to ensure reliability and correctness across all edge cases. Testing is critical for educational code that will be used by students and educators.

**Relevant Source Tree:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Test module: Should follow naming convention (e.g., `test_bubble_sort.py`)
- Source being tested: The bubble_sort() function from Story 1.2

**Testing Approach:**
- Use pytest framework (industry standard for Python)
- Implement parameterized tests for efficiency
- Focus on edge cases and boundary conditions
- Verify pure function behavior (no side effects)

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Empty lists and single-element lists
- Already sorted, reverse sorted, and random data
- Negative numbers, floats, mixed types
- Duplicate values
- Error conditions (None, non-iterable inputs)
- Immutability of input (pure function verification)

**Coverage Requirements:**
- Target: >95% code coverage
- Use coverage tools (coverage.py or pytest-cov)
- All branches and edge cases must be tested
- Include both positive and negative test cases

**Testing Standards:**
- Tests should be readable and self-documenting
- Use descriptive test method names
- Include docstrings for complex test scenarios
- Group related tests using test classes or markers
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
