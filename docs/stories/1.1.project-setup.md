**Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure**

---

## Status
**Draft**

---

## Epic Reference
**Epic:** 1 - Core Algorithm Foundation

---

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish the project structure with proper Python package setup,
**so that** the code is organized, installable, and follows Python best practices.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create proper Python package structure with __init__.py files
2. Setup.py or pyproject.toml file with project metadata and dependencies
3. README.md with installation instructions and basic usage
4. Basic directory structure for source code, tests, and documentation
5. Git repository initialization with appropriate .gitignore file
6. Basic CI/CD configuration file (GitHub Actions or similar)

## Dev Notes
**Source:** Epic 1 - Core Algorithm Foundation

This story establishes the foundational project structure for the bubble sort implementation project. The project should follow Python best practices with proper packaging, modern tooling, and CI/CD automation.

**Project Context:**
- Focus on educational implementation of bubble sort algorithm
- Target audience: Students, educators, and developers learning sorting algorithms
- Priority on code clarity and documentation over optimization
- Must follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- All code must include type hints

**Testing Standards:**
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Test file location: tests/ directory
- Aim for >95% code coverage
- Include parameterized tests for multiple scenarios

---

## Testing
**Test File Location:** tests/

**Testing Standards:**
- Use pytest framework
- Include unit tests for all functions
- Use parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios
- Test edge cases (empty lists, single elements, etc.)
- Achieve >95% code coverage
- Include both positive and negative test cases
