# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Status
**Status**: Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish the project structure with proper Python package setup,
**So that** the code is organized, installable, and follows Python best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create proper Python package structure with __init__.py files in all package directories
- [ ] Setup.py or pyproject.toml file with project metadata, dependencies, and installation configuration
- [ ] README.md with installation instructions, basic usage examples, and project overview
- [ ] Basic directory structure for source code (src/), tests (tests/), and documentation (docs/)
- [ ] Git repository initialization with appropriate .gitignore file for Python projects

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create project directory structure
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Create src/bubblesort/ directory with __init__.py
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Create tests/ directory with __init__.py
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Create docs/ directory with appropriate structure
  - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Create scripts/ directory for CLI tools
- [ ] Task 2: Configure Python packaging
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Create pyproject.toml with project metadata (name, version, description, authors)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Define build system requirements (setuptools, wheel)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Configure package discovery (src-layout)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Add initial dependencies section (typing for type hints)
- [ ] Task 3: Create comprehensive README.md
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Add project title, description, and badges
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Document installation instructions (pip install -e .)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Add basic usage examples with code snippets
  - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Include development setup instructions
  - [ ] Subtask 3.5: Add testing instructions and coverage reporting
- [ ] Task 4: Initialize Git repository and configure version control
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Run git init in project root
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Create .gitignore for Python projects (include .pytest_cache/, .coverage, __pycache__/, *.pyc, dist/, build/, *.egg-info/)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Make initial commit with project structure
  - [ ] Subtask 4.4: Verify gitignore is working correctly

## Dev Notes
- **Python Version**: Target Python 3.8+ for compatibility with type hints and modern language features
- **Package Layout**: Use src-layout pattern (src/bubblesort/) for better separation of package code from project metadata
- **PEP 517/518 Compliance**: pyproject.toml is the modern standard for Python packaging (prefer over setup.py)
- **Development Dependencies**: Consider adding pytest, pytest-cov, black, ruff, and mypy as development dependencies
- **File Encoding**: Ensure all files use UTF-8 encoding
- **Line Endings**: Configure .gitattributes to handle line endings consistently across platforms
- **Documentation**: README.md should be comprehensive enough that new developers can get started without additional documentation

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- [ ] Verify pyproject.toml is valid and can be read by pip/setuptools
- [ ] Test package can be installed in editable mode (pip install -e .)
- [ ] Verify import structure works correctly after installation
- [ ] Validate .gitignore excludes appropriate files and directories

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test project can be built into a distribution package (python -m build)
- [ ] Verify package can be installed from built wheel/source distribution
- [ ] Test that source structure allows proper module imports in installed package

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Clone fresh repository and verify setup instructions work from README.md
- [ ] Test installation on clean Python environment (virtual environment recommended)
- [ ] Verify directory structure matches expectations after setup
- [ ] Confirm all files are tracked by git except those in .gitignore
