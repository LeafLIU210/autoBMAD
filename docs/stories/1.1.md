# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

**Status:** Done
**Epic:** Epic 1: Core Algorithm Foundation

## User Story
**As a developer,**
I want to establish the project structure with proper Python package setup,
so that the code is organized, installable, and follows Python best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create proper Python package structure with `__init__.py` files
2. Setup.py or pyproject.toml file with project metadata and dependencies
3. README.md with installation instructions and basic usage
4. Basic directory structure for source code, tests, and documentation
5. Git repository initialization with appropriate .gitignore file
6. Basic CI/CD configuration file (GitHub Actions or similar)

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [ ] Create project root directory structure
- [ ] Initialize Python package with `__init__.py` files
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml with project metadata
- [ ] Generate initial README.md with installation and usage
- [ ] Set up tests directory with sample test file
- [ ] Initialize git repository
- [ ] Create .gitignore for Python projects
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- [ ] Configure code quality tools (ruff, black, mypy)

## Dev Notes

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use pyproject.toml instead of setup.py (modern Python packaging standard)
- Include development dependencies: pytest, ruff, black, mypy, coverage
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints throughout the codebase
- Ensure proper namespace package structure

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Source code in `src/` directory (src-layout pattern)
- Tests in `tests/` directory
- Documentation in `docs/` directory
- Configuration files in root directory

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Development tools: pytest, coverage, ruff, black, mypy

## Testing

**Testing Strategy:**
- No functional code to test in this story
- Verify project structure after creation
- Run `python -m build` to ensure package builds correctly
- Test installation in virtual environment
- Verify CI/CD pipeline runs successfully

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] Package can be built without errors
- [ ] Package can be installed in development mode
- [ ] All directories exist with proper structure
- [ ] CI/CD workflow executes successfully

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Project structure follows Python best practices
- [ ] Package builds and installs successfully
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured and passing
- [ ] Code quality tools configured
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- [ ] All tasks completed and checked off

## Additional Information

**Estimated Effort:** 2 days
**Dependencies:** None
**Priority:** High
**Risk Level:** Low

**Success Metrics:**
- Package build: Success
- Installation: Success
- CI/CD: Passing
- Code quality tools: Configured and passing

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Review Summary:**
Comprehensive QA review completed for Story 1.1 - Project Setup and Infrastructure. All acceptance criteria have been successfully implemented with a solid foundation established for the project.

**Document Completeness:** ✅ 100%
- All story sections complete and well-documented
- Acceptance criteria clearly defined and measurable
- Technical considerations thoroughly documented

**Implementation Verification:**
- ✅ Python package structure with proper `__init__.py` files
- ✅ pyproject.toml with modern hatchling build system
- ✅ README.md with clear installation and usage instructions
- ✅ Source structure following src-layout pattern
- ✅ Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore
- ✅ CI/CD workflow configured for multiple Python versions (3.8-3.12)
- ✅ Code quality tools configured (ruff, pytest, basedpyright)

**Tool Validation Results:**
- **Tests:** 19/19 tests passing ✅
- **Package Build:** Successfully built wheel ✅
- **Ruff Linting:** 2 minor warnings (B904 exception handling)
- **Basedpyright:** 9 type warnings (non-critical)
- **Coverage:** Configured and reporting (0% for cli.py expected for infrastructure)

**Gate Status**

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/epic-1.1-project-setup-infrastructure.yml

**Recommendations:**
1. Address Ruff B904 warnings by using `raise ... from err` pattern
2. Consider adding type annotations to cli.py for improved type safety
3. Update task checklist to reflect completed implementation
4. Proceed with Epic 1 development - infrastructure is solid
