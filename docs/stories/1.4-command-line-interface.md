# Story 1.4: Command-Line Interface

**Status:** Ready for Development

---

## Story

**As a user,**
I want a command-line interface to test the bubble sort algorithm,
so that I can easily demonstrate and experiment with the implementation.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create CLI entry point that accepts arrays as command-line arguments
2. Support reading arrays from files or standard input
3. Provide options for different output formats (sorted array, detailed process)
4. Include help documentation and usage examples
5. Handle command-line errors gracefully with helpful error messages
6. Support both interactive and batch modes of operation

## Dev Notes

This story adds a command-line interface to make the bubble sort implementation easily accessible for demonstration and experimentation. This is particularly valuable for educational use, allowing students and educators to quickly test the algorithm.

**Relevant Source Tree:**
- CLI module: New module for command-line interface
- Entry point: Configured in pyproject.toml
- Integration: Uses bubble_sort() function from Story 1.2

**Interface Design:**
- Clean, intuitive command-line interface
- Support multiple input methods (args, file, stdin)
- Flexible output formatting for different use cases
- Helpful error messages and documentation

**Usage Scenarios:**
- Quick sorting of numbers from command line
- Educational demonstrations with process visualization
- Batch processing of multiple datasets
- Integration with shell scripts and automation

**Key Features:**
- Command-line argument parsing
- File input/output capabilities
- Multiple output formats
- Interactive mode for learning
- Comprehensive help system

**Educational Value:**
- Makes the algorithm easily accessible
- Enables quick experimentation
- Supports teaching and demonstration
- Allows students to test various inputs

**Testing Standards:**
- Test CLI with various input combinations
- Verify error handling for invalid inputs
- Test both interactive and batch modes
- Ensure help documentation is accurate
- Test file I/O operations
