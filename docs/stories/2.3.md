# Story 2.3: Algorithm Comparison Tools

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As an** educator,
**I want** tools to compare bubble sort with other fundamental sorting algorithms,
**so that** students can understand the trade-offs between different approaches.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement insertion sort and selection sort for comparison
2. Create side-by-side comparison of time complexity and space complexity
3. Visual comparison showing algorithm steps for each sorting method
4. Generate summary tables of algorithm characteristics and best-use scenarios

## Dev Notes
- **Epic Reference:** Epic 2 - Algorithm Optimization and Analysis
- **Dependencies:** Story 2.2 (Performance Benchmarking Framework)
- **Estimated Effort:** 5 days
- **Priority:** Medium

### Implementation Guidance
- **Insertion Sort:** O(n²) average, O(n) best case on nearly sorted data, stable, adaptive
- **Selection Sort:** O(n²) all cases, not stable, minimal swaps
- **Bubble Sort:** O(n²) average, O(n) best case (optimized), stable, adaptive

### Algorithm Characteristics to Document
| Algorithm | Best | Average | Worst | Space | Stable | Adaptive |
|-----------|------|---------|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| Bubble Sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | Yes | Yes |
| Insertion Sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | Yes | Yes |
| Selection Sort | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | No | No |

### Educational Focus
- Emphasize when to use (or not use) bubble sort in practice
- Focus on educational value of performance analysis
- Provide clear explanations of complexity theory
- Comparison algorithms implemented target: 3+ (bubble, insertion, selection)

### Testing
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Verify insertion sort and selection sort correctness
- Test visual output generation
- Validate theoretical calculations
- Test recommendation engine with various scenarios
