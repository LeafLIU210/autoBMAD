# Story 2.2: Performance Benchmarking Framework

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** data analyst,
**I want** comprehensive performance testing tools,
**so that** I can measure and analyze the algorithm's behavior across different scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create benchmarking framework that measures execution time, comparisons, and swaps
2. Test with various input sizes (10, 100, 1000, 10000 elements)
3. Test with different input distributions (sorted, reverse, random, partially sorted)
4. Generate performance reports with graphs and statistical analysis
5. Compare bubble sort against Python's built-in sort() function
6. Export results in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, plain text)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create core benchmarking framework (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create benchmark module/class structure
  - [ ] Implement execution time measurement (high-precision timing)
  - [ ] Add comparison counter instrumentation
  - [ ] Add swap counter instrumentation
  - [ ] Create wrapper functions for instrumented sorting
- [ ] Task 2: Implement test data generators (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create generator for various input sizes (10, 100, 1000, 10000)
  - [ ] Create sorted array generator
  - [ ] Create reverse-sorted array generator
  - [ ] Create random array generator

  - [ ] Calculate 95th percentile metrics
  - [ ] Implement multiple-run averaging for accuracy
  - [ ] Generate variance analysis
- [ ] Task 4: Implement report generation with graphs (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create text-based performance summary
  - [ ] Generate comparison charts/graphs (matplotlib or similar)
  - [ ] Create time complexity visualization
- [ ] Task 5: Add Python built-in sort comparison (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Instrument Python's sort() for comparison
  - [ ] Create side-by-side benchmark runs
  - [ ] Generate comparison analysis
- [ ] Task 6: Implement export functionality (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Export to CSV format
  - [ ] Export to JSON format
  - [ ] Export to plain text format
  - [ ] Include all metrics and statistical data in exports

## Dev Notes
- **Epic Reference:** Epic 2 - Algorithm Optimization and Analysis
- **Dependencies:** Story 2.1 (Optimized Bubble Sort Variants)
- **Estimated Effort:** 5 days
- **Priority:** High

### Implementation Guidance
- Use `time.perf_counter()` for high-precision timing
- Run multiple iterations (suggest 10+) and average results for statistical validity
- Consider memory usage during large dataset tests
- Focus on educational value - clearly explain what metrics mean
- Performance measurement accuracy target: ±1% variance

### Statistical Requirements
- Include 95th percentile calculations
- Calculate standard deviation for all metrics
- Multiple runs required for statistical significance

### Testing
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Verify benchmark accuracy with known inputs
- Test export formats are valid (CSV parseable, JSON valid)
- Test statistical calculations against known values
- Ensure graphs generate correctly
