# Story 1.2: Basic Bubble Sort Implementation

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a working bubble sort algorithm that can sort lists of numbers,
**so that** I can understand and use the fundamental sorting algorithm.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement bubble_sort() function that accepts a list and returns a sorted copy
2. Function handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly
3. Raises appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs (None, non-iterable)
4. Includes comprehensive docstring with algorithm explanation and complexity analysis
5. Implementation follows the standard bubble sort algorithm with nested loops
6. Type hints for all function parameters and return values

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement core bubble_sort function (AC: #1, #5, #6)
  - [ ] Create function with proper signature and type hints
  - [ ] Implement nested loop logic for bubble sort algorithm
  - [ ] Return a sorted copy without modifying original list
  - [ ] Handle empty and single-element lists (AC: #2)
- [ ] Add input validation and error handling (AC: #3)
  - [ ] Check for None inputs
  - [ ] Validate input is iterable
  - [ ] Raise appropriate exceptions with helpful messages
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation (AC: #4)
  - [ ] Write detailed docstring explaining algorithm
  - [ ] Include complexity analysis (time and space)
  - [ ] Add usage examples in docstring
  - [ ] Document parameter types and return values
- [ ] Add type hints throughout (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Add type hints for function parameters
  - [ ] Add return type hints
  - [ ] Import necessary typing modules

## Dev Notes
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: tests/test_bubble_sort.py
- Test standards: Use pytest with parameterized tests
- Testing frameworks: pytest, coverage.py for coverage
- Code coverage: Target >95% coverage for this module

### Relevant Information
- Dependencies: Story 1.1 (Project Setup)
- Algorithm: Standard bubble sort with O(n²) time complexity
- Behavior: Pure function - does not modify input list
- Educational focus: Code should be clear and well-commented for learning
- Error handling: Be explicit with exception types and messages

### Source Tree Considerations
- Main implementation: bubblesort/ directory (from Story 1.1)
- Module file: bubblesort/bubble_sort.py or similar
- Public API: bubble_sort() function should be importable
- Maintain clean separation between algorithm and CLI

### Technical Considerations
- Use List[int] | List[float] for numeric types
- Consider using TypeVar for generic list types
- Follow DRY principles - avoid code duplication
- Keep implementation simple and readable
- Focus on correctness over optimization
