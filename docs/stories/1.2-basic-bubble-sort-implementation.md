# Story 1.2: Basic Bubble Sort Implementation

**Status:** Ready for Development

---

## Story

**As a user,**
I want a working bubble sort algorithm that can sort lists of numbers,
so that I can understand and use the fundamental sorting algorithm.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Implement bubble_sort() function that accepts a list and returns a sorted copy
2. Function handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly
3. Raises appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs (None, non-iterable)
4. Includes comprehensive docstring with algorithm explanation and complexity analysis
5. Implementation follows the standard bubble sort algorithm with nested loops
6. Type hints for all function parameters and return values

---

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement core bubble_sort function (AC: #1, #5)
  - [ ] Create function signature with type hints
  - [ ] Implement nested loop structure for bubble sort
  - [ ] Return sorted copy without modifying original list
- [ ] Task 2: Handle edge cases (AC: #2)
  - [ ] Test and handle empty list input
  - [ ] Test and handle single-element list input
  - [ ] Verify already-sorted lists work correctly
- [ ] Task 3: Implement error handling (AC: #3)
  - [ ] Raise exception for None input
  - [ ] Raise exception for non-iterable inputs
  - [ ] Add appropriate error messages
- [ ] Task 4: Add comprehensive documentation (AC: #4)
  - [ ] Write detailed docstring explaining algorithm
  - [ ] Include time and space complexity analysis
  - [ ] Add usage examples in docstring
  - [ ] Document parameters and return values

## Dev Notes

This story implements the core bubble sort algorithm. Despite its O(n²) time complexity, bubble sort is chosen for its educational value and visual nature, making it ideal for teaching sorting concepts.

**Relevant Source Tree:**
- Implementation location: Main module in source directory
- Function name: `bubble_sort()`
- The function should be in a module that can be imported

**Algorithm Details:**
- Standard bubble sort with nested loops
- Compare adjacent elements and swap if needed
- Repeat until no swaps are needed (list is sorted)
- Return a new sorted list (pure function - don't modify input)

**Educational Focus:**
- Code should be clear and well-commented
- Emphasize readability over optimization
- Include algorithm explanation in docstring
- Suitable for students learning sorting algorithms

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/` directory
- Use pytest framework
- Achieve >95% code coverage
- Test edge cases: empty lists, single elements, already sorted
- Test with different data types: integers, floats, negative numbers
- Verify original input is not modified
