# Story 1.2: Basic Bubble Sort Implementation

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a working bubble sort algorithm that can sort lists of numbers,
**so that** I can understand and use the fundamental sorting algorithm.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement bubble_sort() function that accepts a list and returns a sorted copy
2. Function handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly
3. Raises appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs (None, non-iterable)
4. Includes comprehensive docstring with algorithm explanation and complexity analysis
5. Implementation follows the standard bubble sort algorithm with nested loops
6. Type hints for all function parameters and return values

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create src/ directory structure with __init__.py
- [ ] Implement bubble_sort() function with proper algorithm logic (AC: #1, #5)
  - [ ] Implement nested loop structure for bubble sort
  - [ ] Add swap logic to bubble larger elements to the end
- [ ] Add input validation for None and non-iterable inputs (AC: #3)
- [ ] Handle edge cases: empty list and single element (AC: #2)
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstring with algorithm explanation and O(n²) complexity analysis (AC: #4)
- [ ] Add type hints for function parameters and return values (AC: #6)
- [ ] Test function manually with various inputs
- [ ] Ensure function returns a new sorted list (doesn't modify original)

## Dev Notes
This story implements the core bubble sort algorithm. The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Key implementation details:
- The algorithm has O(n²) time complexity, making it inefficient for large lists
- It's a stable sort (doesn't change relative order of equal elements)
- It works in-place (modifies the list) but our implementation should return a copy to be a pure function

### Testing Standards
- Test file should be located at tests/test_bubble_sort.py
- Use pytest framework with parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
- Test edge cases: empty list, single element, already sorted, reverse sorted
- Test error handling for invalid inputs
- Ensure >95% code coverage

### Source Tree Information
- Main implementation should be in src/bubble_sort.py or similar
- Function name: bubble_sort()
- Return type: List[Union[int, float]] (for generic numeric sorting)
