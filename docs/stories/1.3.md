# Story 1.3: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Status
**Status**: Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** thorough unit tests for the bubble sort implementation,
**So that** I can be confident the algorithm works correctly for all edge cases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Test empty list, single element, and multiple element scenarios
- [x] Test already sorted, reverse sorted, and random order inputs
- [x] Test with negative numbers, floats, and mixed numeric types
- [x] Test error handling for None, non-iterable, and non-comparable inputs
- [x] Test that original input list is not modified (pure function behavior)
- [x] Achieve >95% code coverage for the bubble sort implementation (100% achieved)
- [x] Include parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Set up testing framework (pytest, coverage tools)
- [x] Task 2: Create basic test structure and test file organization
- [x] Task 3: Implement unit tests for edge cases (empty, single element)
- [x] Task 4: Implement unit tests for various input orders (sorted, reverse, random)
- [x] Task 5: Implement unit tests for numeric edge cases (negative, floats, mixed)
- [x] Task 6: Implement unit tests for error handling and validation
- [x] Task 7: Implement tests for pure function behavior (input immutability)
- [x] Task 8: Refactor tests to use parameterized test patterns
- [x] Task 9: Generate and verify >95% code coverage report
- [x] Task 10: Review and validate all test cases meet acceptance criteria

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Summary
Comprehensive testing suite for bubble sort implementation has been completed with the following results:

**Test Results:**
- **61 tests passing** (100% pass rate)
- **100% code coverage** (exceeds >95% requirement)
- **Ruff linting:** All checks passed
- **0 errors, 0 warnings**

**Test Suite Structure:**
- TestBubbleSort: 22 tests covering basic functionality and edge cases
- TestBubbleSortErrorHandling: 3 tests for error handling
- TestBubbleSortParameterized: 25 tests using parametrized patterns
- TestBubbleSortImmutability: 5 tests for pure function behavior
- TestBubbleSortPerformanceAndCorrectness: 6 tests for performance and correctness validation

**Acceptance Criteria Verification:**
✅ All 7 acceptance criteria met and verified
✅ All 10 tasks completed successfully
✅ Code coverage exceeds requirements (100% vs >95%)
✅ Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases, negative numbers, floats, mixed types, error handling, and immutability

**Files Modified:**
- `tests/test_bubble_sort.py` - Complete test suite with 61 comprehensive tests
- `src/bubblesort/bubble_sort.py` - Bubble sort implementation under test

### Dev Notes
- Use pytest framework with fixtures for test organization
- Implement pytest.mark.parametrize for testing multiple scenarios efficiently
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
- Include clear test docstrings explaining what is being tested and why
- Use assertions with descriptive error messages
- Follow Ralph's principles: tests should be simple, clear, and maintainable
- Document any assumptions or limitations in test design
- Consider edge cases not explicitly mentioned: very large lists, lists with duplicates
- Maintain test coverage metrics throughout development

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- [x] Empty list input test
- [x] Single element list test
- [x] Two element list test (already sorted)
- [x] Two element list test (reverse sorted)
- [x] Multiple element list test (already sorted)
- [x] Multiple element list test (reverse sorted)
- [x] Multiple element list test (random order)
- [x] List with negative integers
- [x] List with floating point numbers
- [x] List with mixed numeric types (int and float)
- [x] List with duplicate values
- [x] List with all identical values
- [x] Large list test (performance and correctness)
- [x] Verify None input raises TypeError
- [x] Verify non-iterable input raises TypeError
- [x] Verify input list is not modified after function call

### Integration Tests
- [x] Test bubble_sort function integration with different input sources
- [x] Verify consistent behavior across different Python versions
- [x] Test memory efficiency with large datasets

### Manual Testing
- [x] Run test suite manually to verify all tests pass
- [x] Generate and review coverage report
- [x] Validate coverage meets >95% threshold
- [x] Run tests with different Python interpreters if applicable
