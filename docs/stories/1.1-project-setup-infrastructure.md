# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish the project structure with proper Python package setup,
**so that** the code is organized, installable, and follows Python best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create proper Python package structure with __init__.py files
2. Setup.py or pyproject.toml file with project metadata and dependencies
3. README.md with installation instructions and basic usage
4. Basic directory structure for source code, tests, and documentation
5. Git repository initialization with appropriate .gitignore file
6. Basic CI/CD configuration file (GitHub Actions or similar)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create main package directory with __init__.py
- [ ] Create tests directory structure with __init__.py
- [ ] Create docs directory for documentation
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml with project metadata and dependencies
- [ ] Create .gitignore file for Python projects
- [ ] Create README.md with installation and usage instructions
- [ ] Create basic CI/CD configuration (GitHub Actions workflow)
- [ ] Initialize git repository if not already done
- [ ] Verify package structure is correct and installable

## Dev Notes
This story establishes the foundational project structure for the bubble sort implementation. The project follows Python best practices with a proper package layout.

### Testing Standards
- Test files should be located in tests/ directory
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Maintain >95% code coverage requirement
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
