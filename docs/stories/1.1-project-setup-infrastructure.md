# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish the project structure with proper Python package setup,
**so that** the code is organized, installable, and follows Python best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create proper Python package structure with __init__.py files
2. Setup.py or pyproject.toml file with project metadata and dependencies
3. README.md with installation instructions and basic usage
4. Basic directory structure for source code, tests, and documentation
5. Git repository initialization with appropriate .gitignore file
6. Basic CI/CD configuration file (GitHub Actions or similar)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create project root directory structure (AC: #1, #4)
  - [x] Create main source package directory with __init__.py
  - [x] Create tests directory with __init__.py
  - [x] Create docs directory for documentation
- [x] Setup package configuration (AC: #2)
  - [x] Create pyproject.toml with project metadata
  - [x] Define package dependencies and development dependencies
  - [x] Configure package entry points if needed
- [x] Create documentation (AC: #3)
  - [x] Write README.md with installation instructions
  - [x] Add basic usage examples
  - [x] Include project description and goals
- [x] Initialize version control (AC: #5)
  - [x] Ensure git repository is initialized
  - [x] Create .gitignore for Python projects
  - [x] Add appropriate ignore patterns (pycache, venv, etc.)
- [x] Setup CI/CD pipeline (AC: #6)
  - [x] Create .github/workflows directory
  - [x] Create basic GitHub Actions workflow
  - [x] Configure workflow to run tests on push/PR

## Dev Notes
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: tests/ directory
- Test standards: Follow Python testing best practices with pytest
- Testing frameworks: Use pytest for unit testing
- Code coverage: Target >95% coverage

### Relevant Information
- This is the foundational story that all other stories depend on
- Project type: Python package with CLI capabilities
- Focus on simplicity and clarity over complexity
- Ensure all code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints throughout the codebase

### Source Tree Considerations
- Main package: Root level package directory
- Test files: tests/ directory paralleling source structure
- Documentation: docs/ directory for project docs
- Configuration: pyproject.toml for modern Python packaging

## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2026-01-05 | 1.0 | Initial story creation from Epic 1 | Scrum Master |
| 2026-01-05 | 1.1 | Fixed missing src/__init__.py and completed TDD cycle | James (Dev Agent) |

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach using pytest for validation. Implemented missing Python package structure component (src/__init__.py) based on failing test feedback. All 20 project setup tests now pass.

### Debug Log References
- Test execution: All 20 tests in tests/test_project_setup.py pass
- Test report: test_results.json (generated by pytest-json-report)
- Initial failure: test_src_is_python_package (missing src/__init__.py)
- Fix applied: Created src/__init__.py to establish proper Python package structure
- Re-validation: All tests pass after fix

### Completion Notes List
1. **Issue Found**: src directory missing __init__.py file - prevented it from being a valid Python package
2. **Test-Driven Fix**: Created src/__init__.py file to make src a proper Python package
3. **Validation**: All 20 project setup tests now pass, confirming all 6 ACs are met:
   - AC #1: Python package structure with __init__.py files ✓
   - AC #2: pyproject.toml with metadata and dependencies ✓
   - AC #3: README.md with installation and usage ✓
   - AC #4: Directory structure (src, tests, docs) ✓
   - AC #5: Git repository with .gitignore ✓
   - AC #6: CI/CD with GitHub Actions workflow ✓
4. **Project Structure**: Confirmed existing infrastructure (autoBMAD package, pyproject.toml, README, CI/CD) was already in place
5. **TDD Cycle**: Completed 1 full TDD iteration - test failed, implemented fix, all tests pass

### File List
- src/__init__.py (created - makes src a proper Python package)
- tests/test_project_setup.py (validated - all 20 tests pass)
- pyproject.toml (validated - proper configuration present)
- README.md (validated - contains installation and usage)
- .gitignore (validated - Python ignore patterns present)
- .github/workflows/ci.yml (validated - CI/CD workflow present)
- autoBMAD/ (validated - main package directory with py.typed)
