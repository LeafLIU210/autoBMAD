final_decision: "FAIL"

pass_criteria_met:
  - document_completeness_100: false
  - no_critical_failures: false
  - tool_results_not_fail: false

critical_issues:
  - "Status incorrectly shows 'Ready for Development' when no work has been completed"
  - "All 7 acceptance criteria remain unmarked as incomplete"
  - "All 20 subtasks across 5 major tasks remain unmarked as incomplete"
  - "Zero implementation artifacts exist (no directory, no Python files, no tests)"
  - "Story is not ready for QA review - still in planning phase"

recommendations:
  - "Change story status from 'Ready for Development' to 'Not Started'"
  - "Complete implementation of all 7 acceptance criteria before requesting QA review"
  - "Mark tasks/subtasks as complete as work is finished"
  - "Ensure autoBMAD/spec_automation/ directory structure is created"
  - "Implement doc_parser.py with all required functionality"
  - "Implement spec_state_manager.py with spec_progress.db"
  - "Create comprehensive unit tests achieving >80% coverage"
  - "Verify no .bmad-core dependency through import testing"
  - "Re-request QA review only after implementation is complete"
