**Story**: 1.4 - SpecDriver Orchestrator Implementation
**Status**: Done
**Review Date**: 2026-01-09
**QA Engineer**: Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)

## Gate Decision

### ✅ PASS

**Rationale**:
- Document completeness: 100% ✓
- Implementation completeness: 100% ✓
- Quality gates: ALL PASS ✓
  - Ruff (Linting): 0 errors ✓
  - BasedPyright (Type Checking): 0 errors, 17 acceptable warnings ✓
  - Pytest (Tests): 12/12 tests passing ✓
- All 8 acceptance criteria: COMPLETE ✓
- Code quality: Production-ready ✓

1. ✅ AC #1: Create spec_driver.py with complete orchestration logic - COMPLETE
2. ✅ AC #2: Implement workflow pipeline (Document Parse → Dev → QA → Quality Gates) - COMPLETE
3. ✅ AC #3: Coordinate Dev-QA cycles - COMPLETE
4. ✅ AC #4: Integrate quality gates (Ruff, BasedPyright, Pytest) - COMPLETE
5. ✅ AC #5: Implement iteration control - COMPLETE
6. ✅ AC #6: Generate comprehensive execution summary reports - COMPLETE
7. ✅ AC #7: Error handling and recovery mechanisms - COMPLETE
8. ✅ AC #8: End-to-end workflow testing - COMPLETE

## Quality Metrics

**Code Quality**:
- Ruff: 0 errors
- BasedPyright: 0 errors, 17 warnings (acceptable - SDK Any types)
- Pytest: 12/12 tests passing
- Test Coverage: >80% achieved

**Implementation Status**:
- spec_driver.py: 7,248 bytes (production-ready)
- test_spec_driver.py: 5,651 bytes (12 comprehensive tests)
- All components integrated: DocParser, SpecDevAgent, SpecQAAgent, QualityGateRunner, SpecStateManager

**Technical Quality**:
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns ✓
- Type hints throughout ✓
- Async/await patterns correctly implemented ✓
- Logging integration ✓
- Comprehensive error handling ✓
- State machine pattern for workflow phases ✓

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ SpecDriver implementation verified (7,248 bytes)
2. ✅ All component integrations verified
3. ✅ Workflow pipeline tested
4. ✅ Dev-QA iteration control verified
5. ✅ Quality gates integration confirmed
6. ✅ Iteration control mechanisms tested
7. ✅ Comprehensive reporting validated
8. ✅ Error handling verified
9. ✅ End-to-end testing completed

## Decision Summary

**APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**

This story has been thoroughly reviewed and meets all quality standards. The SpecDriver implementation is complete, production-ready, and all acceptance criteria have been met. Quality gates pass across all three tools (Ruff, BasedPyright, Pytest).

**Status**: Story is complete and ready for deployment.

## Recommendations
