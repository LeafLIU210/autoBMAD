decision: FAIL

document_completeness:
  score: 30%
  required: 100%
  items:
    story_title: true
    status_field: true
    acceptance_criteria: false
    tasks_subtasks: false

tool_validation:
  status: WAIVED
  reason: No code implementation to validate

rationale: |
  The story document is incomplete. Missing required elements:
  - Acceptance criteria (required for testability)
  - Tasks/Subtasks (required for tracking implementation)

  Document completeness must reach 100% before QA can pass.

recommendations:
  - Add acceptance criteria with Given-When-Then format
  - Define tasks and subtasks for implementation tracking
  - Resubmit for review when document is complete
