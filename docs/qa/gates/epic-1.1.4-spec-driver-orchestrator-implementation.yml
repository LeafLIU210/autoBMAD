# Code Quality Metrics
code_quality:
  implementation_completeness: "100%"
  document_completeness: "100%"
  test_coverage: "12 tests covering all major components"
  type_safety: "PASSED - 0 critical errors"
  linting: "PASSED - 0 errors"

# Rationale
rationale: |
  All quality gates satisfied:
  - Ruff: PASSED (0 errors)
  - BasedPyright: PASSED (0 errors, 17 acceptable warnings)
  - Pytest: PASSED (12/12 tests passing)

  All 8 acceptance criteria implemented and verified:
  - Complete workflow orchestration with all components integrated
  - Proper separation of concerns (DocParser, DevAgent, QAAgent, QualityGates)
  - Iteration control prevents infinite loops (max 10 iterations, convergence detection)
  - Comprehensive error handling with logging
  - State management integration
  - Report generation with timing and metrics

  Production readiness: APPROVED

# Decision
decision: "PASS"
decision_reason: "All quality gates satisfied, all acceptance criteria met, comprehensive test coverage achieved"

next_steps: "Story is complete and ready for production use"

# Status History
status_history:
