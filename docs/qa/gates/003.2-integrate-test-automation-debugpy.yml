nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Subprocess execution properly validated for pytest. File path validation for test directory checks. Proper error handling prevents information leakage. No shell=True for subprocess calls. JSON report parsing is safe and validated.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Async subprocess execution for pytest. Proper timeout controls on debugpy operations (300s). Efficient JSON parsing for test results. State manager integration with proper indexing. Fallback mechanism when workflow modules unavailable.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout. Graceful handling of missing dependencies. Retry logic with max 5 iterations. State persistence via state manager. Backward compatibility via --skip-tests flag. All error scenarios properly handled.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive type annotations using Python 3.10+ syntax. Google-style docstrings on all public methods. Clean, readable async/await code. All 17 tests passing. Proper separation of concerns with dedicated modules for workflow and integration.'
