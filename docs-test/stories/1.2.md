# Story 1.2: Basic Bubble Sort Implementation

## Story Details
**Epic:** Core Algorithm Foundation
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 3 days
**Dependencies:** Story 1.1

## User Story
**As a user,**
I want a working bubble sort algorithm that can sort lists of numbers,
so that I can understand and use the fundamental sorting algorithm.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement bubble_sort() function that accepts a list and returns a sorted copy
2. Function handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly
3. Raises appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs (None, non-iterable)
4. Includes comprehensive docstring with algorithm explanation and complexity analysis
5. Implementation follows the standard bubble sort algorithm with nested loops
6. Type hints for all function parameters and return values

## Tasks/Subtasks
- [ ] Implement bubble_sort() function with nested loops
- [ ] Add input validation (None, non-iterable checks)
- [ ] Write comprehensive docstring
- [ ] Add type hints
- [ ] Handle edge cases (empty list, single element)
- [ ] Ensure function returns a new list (pure function)

## Dev Notes
- Bubble sort algorithm: repeatedly step through the list, compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order
- Time complexity: O(n²) in worst and average cases
- Space complexity: O(1) - sorts in place
- Implementation should be clear and educational
- Follow Ralph's principles: DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Occam's Razor

## Testing
- Test with empty list
- Test with single element
- Test with multiple elements
- Test with already sorted array
- Test with reverse sorted array
- Test with random order
- Test with negative numbers
- Test with floats
- Test error handling for None
- Test error handling for non-iterable
- Verify original list is not modified

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Function implemented according to specification
- [ ] All edge cases handled correctly
- [ ] Comprehensive docstring included
- [ ] Type hints implemented
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8
- [ ] Function is pure (doesn't modify input)
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
