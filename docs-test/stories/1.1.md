# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Status
**Status**: Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish the project structure with proper Python package setup,
**so that** the code is organized, installable, and follows Python best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create proper Python package structure with __init__.py files
2. Setup.py or pyproject.toml file with project metadata and dependencies
3. README.md with installation instructions and basic usage
4. Basic directory structure for source code, tests, and documentation
5. Git repository initialization with appropriate .gitignore file

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create Python package structure (AC: #1)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create main package directory with __init__.py
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Create subdirectories for modules with __init__.py files
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Organize code into logical module structure

- [x] Task 2: Setup project configuration file (AC: #2)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create pyproject.toml with project metadata
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Add project name, version, and description
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Configure Python dependencies (typing, pytest, etc.)

- [x] Task 3: Create documentation files (AC: #3)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Write comprehensive README.md with project overview
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Add installation instructions (pip install)
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Include basic usage examples and quick start guide
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Document project structure and key files

- [x] Task 4: Establish directory structure (AC: #4)
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Create src/ directory for source code
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Create tests/ directory for test files
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Create docs/ directory for documentation
  - [x] Subtask 4.4: Add .github/ for CI/CD workflows

- [x] Task 5: Initialize Git repository (AC: #5)
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Initialize git repository
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Create .gitignore file for Python projects
  - [x] Subtask 5.3: Add common exclusions (.pyc, __pycache__, .venv, etc.)
  - [x] Subtask 5.4: Make initial commit with project structure

## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Organization
Based on the project structure defined in the Epic, organize the source tree as follows:
- **Root**: Project root with pyproject.toml and README.md
- **src/**: Source code directory containing the main package
- **tests/**: Test files matching the source structure
- **docs/**: Documentation (already established with epics, stories, architecture)

### Technical Considerations
- Follow PEP 517/518 standards using pyproject.toml for modern Python packaging
- Ensure package is installable in development mode with `pip install -e .`
- Maintain clean separation between source code and test files
- Use type hints throughout (Python 3.9+ compatibility)
- Prepare for future integration with testing frameworks (pytest)

### Testing Standards
Based on the Architecture document requirements:
- Test file location: tests/ directory, mirroring src/ structure
- Test framework: pytest with pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- Testing standards: Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Coverage target: >95% as defined in Epic success metrics
- Test files should be named test_*.py or *_test.py
- All test functions should start with test_ prefix

### Key Implementation Notes
- This story establishes the foundation for all subsequent stories in Epic 1
- The package structure should be designed to accommodate the bubble sort algorithm and future algorithms
- Ensure __init__.py files allow proper module imports
- The .gitignore should be comprehensive to prevent committing temporary files, IDE configurations, and virtual environments

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test package can be imported successfully
- [ ] Test pyproject.toml is valid and contains required metadata
- [ ] Test package can be installed in development mode
- [ ] Test __init__.py files properly expose modules
- [ ] Test directory structure matches expected layout

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test installation from source works correctly
- [ ] Test that module imports work after installation
- [ ] Test Git repository is properly initialized
- [ ] Test .gitignore excludes appropriate files

### Manual Testing
- [x] Manually verify package structure is complete
- [x] Verify README.md is readable and informative
- [x] Test that `python -m pip install -e .` works from project root
- [x] Confirm all required directories and files are present
