# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Story Details
**Epic:** Core Algorithm Foundation
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 2 days
**Dependencies:** None

## User Story
**As a developer,**
I want to establish the project structure with proper Python package setup,
so that the code is organized, installable, and follows Python best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create proper Python package structure with __init__.py files
2. Setup.py or pyproject.toml file with project metadata and dependencies
3. README.md with installation instructions and basic usage
4. Basic directory structure for source code, tests, and documentation
5. Git repository initialization with appropriate .gitignore file
6. Basic CI/CD configuration file (GitHub Actions or similar)

## Tasks/Subtasks
- [ ] Create package directory structure
- [ ] Add __init__.py files to all package directories
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml with project metadata
- [ ] Write comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Initialize git repository
- [ ] Create .gitignore file
- [ ] Setup basic GitHub Actions workflow

## Dev Notes
- Follow Python packaging best practices
- Use modern Python packaging standards (pyproject.toml preferred over setup.py)
- Ensure project is installable in development mode
- Include development dependencies (testing, linting tools)

## Testing
- Verify package can be installed via pip install -e .
- Verify all imports work correctly
- Test CI/CD pipeline runs successfully

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Package structure created and validated
- [ ] Project installs successfully in development mode
- [ ] README.md is comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is configured and passing
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
