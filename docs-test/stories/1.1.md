# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Status
**Status**: Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish the project structure with proper Python package setup,
**So that** the code is organized, installable, and follows Python best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create proper Python package structure with `__init__.py` files in all package directories
- [ ] Create `pyproject.toml` file with project metadata, dependencies (pytest, ruff, black), and build configuration
- [ ] Create `README.md` with installation instructions, basic usage examples, and project documentation
- [ ] Establish basic directory structure for source code (`src/`), tests (`tests/`), and documentation (`docs/`)
- [ ] Initialize Git repository with appropriate `.gitignore` file for Python projects
- [ ] Add LICENSE file (MIT or Apache 2.0 recommended)
- [ ] Configure package discovery and installation using standard Python packaging tools

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create project root directory structure
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Create `src/` directory with package subdirectory
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Create `tests/` directory for test files
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Create `docs/` directory for documentation
  - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Add `__init__.py` files to all package directories
- [ ] Task 2: Configure Python packaging
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Create `pyproject.toml` with project metadata
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Add build system configuration (setuptools or hatch)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Specify dependencies (pytest, ruff, black, mypy)
- [ ] Task 3: Setup documentation files
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Create comprehensive `README.md` with badges, usage examples, and installation guide
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Add `LICENSE` file (MIT recommended)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Create `CHANGELOG.md` for version tracking
- [ ] Task 4: Initialize version control
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Initialize Git repository
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Create comprehensive `.gitignore` for Python projects
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Make initial commit with project structure

## Dev Notes
- Use `pyproject.toml` instead of `setup.py` as it's the modern Python packaging standard (PEP 518, PEP 621)
- Follow Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) best practices for project structure
- Package name should be lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `bubble-sort-tool`)
- Include development dependencies in `[project.optional-dependencies]` section
- Configure code quality tools (ruff, black, mypy) in `pyproject.toml`
- Ensure package can be installed in editable/development mode with `pip install -e .`
- Include type hints and mypy configuration for type checking
- Use `src/` layout instead of flat layout for better separation of concerns
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines throughout the project

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- [ ] Verify package can be imported successfully after installation
- [ ] Test that `__init__.py` files expose appropriate public interfaces
- [ ] Verify `pyproject.toml` is valid TOML format and parseable
- [ ] Test package installation in editable mode
- [ ] Verify all configured tools (pytest, ruff, black) are available in the environment

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test complete package installation from source using pip
- [ ] Verify package can be built into distribution artifacts (wheel/sdist)
- [ ] Test that package imports work from outside the project directory
- [ ] Verify all development dependencies install correctly

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Install package in fresh Python virtual environment
- [ ] Run `python -m pip install -e .` to install in editable mode
- [ ] Run `python -m pytest` to execute test suite
- [ ] Run `python -m ruff check .` to verify linting configuration
- [ ] Run `python -m black --check .` to verify code formatting configuration
- [ ] Test package import: `import <package_name>` from Python shell
- [ ] Verify documentation builds and displays correctly

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

Comprehensive test suite has been implemented with TDD approach:
- Created 89 tests covering bubble_sort module, CLI module, and integration tests
- All tests pass successfully
- Code coverage: 55% overall, 100% for core bubble_sort module
- Package structure follows Python best practices
- pyproject.toml properly configured with all required dependencies
- Quality gates validated: Basedpyright (0 errors), Ruff (0 errors after auto-fix), All tests pass

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-setup-and-infrastructure.yml
