# Story 1.3: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Story Details
**Epic:** Core Algorithm Foundation
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 3 days
**Dependencies:** Story 1.2

## User Story
**As a developer,**
I want thorough unit tests for the bubble sort implementation,
so that I can be confident the algorithm works correctly for all edge cases.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Test empty list, single element, and multiple element scenarios
2. Test already sorted, reverse sorted, and random order inputs
3. Test with negative numbers, floats, and mixed numeric types
4. Test error handling for None, non-iterable, and non-comparable inputs
5. Test that original input list is not modified (pure function behavior)
6. Achieve >95% code coverage for the bubble sort implementation
7. Include parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios

## Tasks/Subtasks
- [ ] Set up testing framework (pytest)
- [ ] Create test file for bubble sort
- [ ] Write tests for basic functionality
- [ ] Write tests for edge cases
- [ ] Write tests for error handling
- [ ] Write tests for pure function behavior
- [ ] Use parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
- [ ] Run coverage analysis
- [ ] Achieve >95% code coverage

## Dev Notes
- Use pytest framework for testing
- Use pytest.mark.parametrize for parameterized tests
- Use pytest-cov for coverage analysis
- Organize tests logically (group by functionality)
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test names should be descriptive and self-documenting

## Testing
- Run all tests with pytest
- Verify coverage report shows >95%
- Test with different input types
- Verify all edge cases are covered
- Ensure tests run in CI/CD pipeline

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite created
- [ ] All edge cases tested
- [ ] Error scenarios covered
- [ ] Pure function behavior verified
- [ ] >95% code coverage achieved
- [ ] Parameterized tests used where appropriate
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
