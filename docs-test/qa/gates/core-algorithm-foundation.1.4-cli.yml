rationale: |
  Story 1.4 passes QA review with high confidence:

  1. **Document Completeness (100%)**: All sections complete including story definition,
     6 acceptance criteria, all tasks marked done, comprehensive testing documentation,
     and detailed dev agent record.

  2. **Test Results**: All 66 tests pass with 98% code coverage on cli.py module.

  3. **Linting (Ruff)**: Clean - no errors or warnings.

  4. **Type Checking (BasedPyright)**: 0 errors, 23 warnings. The warnings are related
     to type hints with `Any` types from argparse Namespace and some reportUnknownMemberType
     issues. These are non-blocking improvements that could be addressed in future refactoring.

  5. **Implementation**: CLI supports all required features - command-line arguments,
     file input, stdin, multiple output formats (default, verbose, JSON), interactive mode,
     and batch mode with proper error handling.

recommendations:
  - Consider adding stricter type hints to CLI argument handling to resolve basedpyright warnings
  - The 23 type warnings are low priority and can be addressed as technical debt cleanup
