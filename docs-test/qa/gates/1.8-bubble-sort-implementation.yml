story_title: 'Implement Bubble Sort Algorithm'
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: 'Story meets all acceptance criteria with comprehensive implementation and excellent test coverage (53 tests passing). Document completeness is 100% with all required sections present. Quality gates show CONCERNS due to type hint deprecation warnings and fixable linting issues, but no critical failures. Story is acceptable with attention to modernization of type annotations.'

top_issues:
  - severity: minor
    issue: 'Type hint deprecation warnings'
    location: 'src/bubblesort/bubble_sort.py:7,10'
    impact: 'Uses deprecated typing constructs (Iterable, List, Union) instead of modern Python 3.9+ syntax'
    recommendation: 'Migrate to collections.abc.Iterable, list, and | union syntax'
  - severity: minor
    issue: 'Ruff linting errors'
    location: 'src/bubblesort/bubble_sort.py:7,10,40'
    impact: '6 fixable style errors related to type annotations and exception handling'
    recommendation: 'Run ruff --fix to automatically correct UP035, UP006, UP007, and B904 issues'
  - severity: minor
    issue: 'Unreachable code warning'
    location: 'src/bubblesort/bubble_sort.py:34'
    impact: 'Type checkers flag unreachable code due to None check on Iterable type'
    recommendation: 'Remove unnecessary None check or use proper type narrowing'
