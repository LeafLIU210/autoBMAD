**Status**: NOT APPLICABLE
**Details**: No code implementation present

### Ruff (Linting)
**Status**: NOT APPLICABLE
**Details**: No code implementation present

### Fixtest (Test Automation)

## Critical Issues Found

2. **Missing Task Breakdown**: No tasks or subtasks are documented to guide implementation
3. **Missing Implementation Details**: No description of what needs to be built
4. **Missing Testing Requirements**: No test strategy or testing approach defined
5. **Incomplete Story Definition**: The story is essentially a placeholder with only a title

## Required Actions Before Next Review
1. Add comprehensive acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then format
2. Break down the story into actionable tasks/subtasks
3. Provide detailed story description and implementation requirements
4. Define testing approach and expected test coverage
5. Add any relevant technical notes or constraints

## Recommendations
- Follow the story template structure (see `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml`)
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are testable and measurable
- Include estimated effort and priority if applicable
- Add any dependencies or blockers

## Next Steps
Update story status to "In Progress" and complete missing sections before requesting another QA review.
