gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "Story successfully implements all acceptance criteria with comprehensive testing (145 tests, 99% coverage). All functionality works correctly. Minor code quality issues identified: deprecated typing syntax (List/Union/Optional), unused imports, and formatting issues. These are non-critical but should be addressed for production readiness."
