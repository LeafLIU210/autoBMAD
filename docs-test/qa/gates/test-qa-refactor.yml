status_reason: 'Document incompleteness prevents QA approval. Story lacks required tasks/subtasks section which is mandatory for 100% document completeness. While the story has a clear description and acceptance criteria, the absence of implementation tasks violates the core requirement that document completeness must reach 100% before QA approval.'
