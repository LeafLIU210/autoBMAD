# Detailed Findings
passing_checks:
  - All 23 unit tests pass successfully
  - 100% code coverage on bubble_sort module
  - Ruff linting passes with no errors or warnings
  - BasedPyright type checking passes with 0 errors/warnings/notes
  - Implementation follows standard bubble sort algorithm correctly
  - Comprehensive docstring with algorithm explanation
  - Correct time/space complexity documentation (O(n²)/O(1))
  - Proper handling of edge cases (empty list, single element, duplicates)
  - Pure function behavior confirmed (input not modified)
  - Support for int, float, and mixed types
  - Early optimization for already-sorted lists (early exit when no swaps occur)
  - Appropriate error handling for invalid inputs
  - Type hints now correctly include `| None` to match runtime behavior

failing_checks: []

concerns: []

technical_debt:
  - None identified

# Quality Attributes Assessment
security:
  status: PASS
  notes: No security concerns identified; proper input validation implemented

performance:
  status: PASS
  notes: Algorithm implementation is correct; early exit optimization present

reliability:
  status: PASS
  notes: All edge cases handled; comprehensive test coverage

maintainability:
  status: PASS
  notes: Well-documented, clean code, follows Python best practices

# Risk Assessment
probability: Low
impact: Low
overall_risk: LOW
rationale: Implementation is solid with excellent test coverage. All quality gates now pass with no concerns identified.

# Recommendations
immediate_actions: []

future_improvements:
  - Consider adding property-based tests using Hypothesis for broader test coverage
  - Could add benchmark tests to track performance regressions
  - Documentation could include visual algorithm trace

# Final Decision
decision_rationale: |
  Story 1.2 now achieves full PASS status! The type hint inconsistency identified in the
  previous review has been successfully resolved. The function signature now correctly includes
  `| None` to match the runtime behavior. All quality gates pass with 100% score:
  - Document completeness: 100%
  - Tool validation: 100% (all tests, linting, and type checking pass)
  - No technical debt identified
  - All functional and non-functional requirements met

  This story demonstrates excellent implementation quality with comprehensive test coverage,
  clean code, proper documentation, and correct type annotations. Ready for production use.
